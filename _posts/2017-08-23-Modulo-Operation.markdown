The definition of modulo operation varies from languages to languages, but why?

In nearly all computing systems, the quotient q and the remainder r of a divided by n satisfy:

$$
q \in \Bbb Z 
$$ a = nq + r
|r| < |n| 
$$

However, this still leaves a sign ambiguity if the remainder is nonzero: two possible choices for the remainder occur, one negative and the other positive, and two possible choices for the quotient occur.
